/*

Package `nogfsog2nd` implements modules that are combined in `cmd/nogfsog2nd`.

DEPRECATED: `nogfsog2nd` is not used.  All GRPCs use `nogfsostad` via
`nogfsoregd`.  Consider dropping nogfsog2nd-related code if it becomes tedious
to maintain.

`RegistryView`: Watches the FSO registry and maintains information about active
repos that are relevant for a nogfsog2nd instance.
