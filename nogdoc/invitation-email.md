Hello,

Nog is a web-based application for collaborative data science.  Potential use
cases include:

 - Exchanging data with collaborators.
 - Developing and running analysis programs at ZIB.
 - Sharing analysis results with collaborators.

Nog is hosted at <https://nog.zib.de>.

Nog is in an early stage.  We'd appreciate feedback and suggestions how to
improve Nog to make it useful for you.

To get started with Nog:

 - Open <https://nog.zib.de/> in your web browser.
 - Use the 'Sign-in / Join' button in the upper right to create an account.
   Use your GitHub account, if you have one, or create an account with
   a password.  Use simple username without special characters that works well
   as a directory on a file system, like 'janedoe'.
 - Ask Marc, Steffen or Vincent to confirm your account.

When your account has been confirmed, got to:
