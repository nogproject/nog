# How to upload data?

To upload data, proceed as follows:

 - Go to <https://nog.zib.de> and use 'Sign in' the top right to log in.
   You will be redirected to the start screen.
 - If you do not yet have a file repository, create one: Click 'New
   Repository' on the start screen.  You will be redirected to a separate page.
   Specify 'Repository Name', select 'File Repository', and click 'Create
   Repository'.  You will be redirected to the new repository.
 - Click 'Upload...' (at the right) to upload your files.  We recommend that
   you upload all files of a dataset together with an annotating text document
   as a single archive (ZIP or tar).

# How to share data?

To make the data visible to other people, you have to share your repository.

 - In your repository, click the button 'Share repository' in the upper right
   corner.
 - If you have not yet configured sharing circles, select the link 'Manage
   circles'.  You will be redirected to your settings.  Specify a circle
   (group) name under 'Create New Circle' and hit 'Create'.  Then iteratively
   add the usernames with whom you want to share your data.
 - Go back to your repository, click the share button again and select the
   circle that you have just created at the 'Add Circle' button.  All data in
   this repository is now visible to the people in the circle.
